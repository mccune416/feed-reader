# Feed Reader

## Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Running application
- Opening index.html will run application
- On the bottom of the page are the tests

## Tests
- RSS Feeds are defined and should have a defined URL and a defined name
- The menu should have menu element hidden by default by having class menu-hidden and when clicked should display/hide the menu
- Initial Entries has entries
- New Feed Selection should load new content when options changes
